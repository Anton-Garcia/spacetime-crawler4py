this is from r/story:

More realistic since the foundation of movement is essentially muscles, nerves, blood vessels, tendons, brain activity, etc. So these zombies would still technically be living are are not technically "undead". The virus causes hightened aggression, higher pain tollerance, mania, impulsivity, etc. These zombies will still need to eat but will eventually die of infections due to unattended wounds or diseases contracted from biting and eating human meat.

"Day 132: The Red Hour"

The sirens stopped working about a month ago.

For a while, they were our lifeline—shrill, piercing signals that told us when to hide, when to run, when to shut the hell up. Now the only warning we get is the Red Hour.

That’s what we call it. About an hour before sunset, like clockwork, the infected become more active. Some say it’s the cooler temperature, others claim it’s circadian—the virus sharpening them up like a blade in time with dusk. All I know is that every evening the air gets tighter, like it’s bracing for something. And then the screaming starts.

We’ve made it 132 days so far. Longer than most.

It started in Kenya.

A mutated strain of rabies, or so we heard. Patient zero was a park ranger bitten by a wild jackal—rabid, frothing, more aggressive than normal. The ranger started showing symptoms in less than a day. Biting people. Screaming at the sun. By the time the World Health Organization knew what it was, it was too late. Global flights, trade routes, military deployments—our interconnected world became a petri dish.

The virus, codenamed M39-K, had a terrifyingly short incubation: 6 to 12 hours. Symptoms: intense aggression, mania, hyperactivity, inability to feel pain. Infected lost impulse control and higher reasoning. But they weren’t dead—not yet. Their hearts beat. Their lungs worked. They bled.

And they bit. God, did they bite.

The U.N. declared martial law within a week. Whole regions were locked down, quarantined, burned. We watched cities fall on live news feeds: Paris, Mumbai, Los Angeles, Manila. One by one, they collapsed not just under the infected, but under their own panic. Human beings are terrible at accepting the end when it comes slowly. We wait too long to act. We always do.

We lost Mom on Day 4.

She was an ER nurse, one of the first to report patients “gnawing” on paramedics. She came home with a chunk missing from her forearm. We tried to patch it. She made it twelve hours.

By the time Dad tried to drive her to the emergency zone, she was already convulsing in the back seat. I still hear the sound she made when she went stiff—like a hiccup through a scream.

She attacked us in the garage. It wasn’t like the movies. No growling or shuffling or evil eyes. She sprinted. Fast. Uncontrolled. A blur of limbs. Dad didn’t even scream—just looked surprised when she knocked him down and tore his throat out.

I was eleven.

We buried Dad the next morning, wrapped in sheets and lowered into a shallow grave behind the gas station. We didn’t bury Mom. Couldn’t. Her body vanished after the attack. We found blood on the driveway and scratch marks on the inside of the garage door. Like she’d kept going, trying to get out.

Kay said we had to leave. She was sixteen then, already taller than me, already harder.

We packed what we could carry and ran.

Now it’s just me and Kay.

She’s nineteen now. Took a bullet to the shoulder last month defending our shelter from a scavenger group, but she’s healing. Tough as hell. Scar down her right eyebrow. Doesn’t cry anymore. Not even when we lost her dog, Rufus.

We live in the attic of an abandoned hardware store. Reinforced the windows. Laid noise traps on the stairwell. The only way in is by ladder, which we pull up after us. We have canned food, a water filter, and a bolt-action rifle with six bullets left.

I’m fifteen. I read books to pass the time. History, mostly. I used to hate history. Now it’s comforting to know the world has ended before—just not like this.

The infected outside still look human—just barely. Veins like black vines under the skin. Torn clothes. Eyes that don't blink enough. Most have missing fingers, broken jaws, untreated burns. Their bodies are rotting while they walk, because they don't stop. No rest. No bandages. No instinct to protect themselves.

But they're alive. That's the horror.

Alive, and slowly dying.

Day 132 began like any other.

Kay was charting a map of known “packs” around the city. We’ve started to notice they form groups—territories. Not like wolves, more like chaotic hives. We call the larger ones “Hordes.” They’re always on the move, following sound or light, anything new.

We heard one around midday—distant, maybe three blocks east. A chorus of hoarse, primal shrieks. We didn't move.

At 5:45 p.m., I noticed something odd through the binoculars: a woman limping down 12th Avenue, alone. Bloodied. Gaunt. Human.

I waved at Kay. She stared for a moment, then whispered, “She’s not infected.”

I opened the window an inch and called out.

The woman looked up. Her eyes were wild, but focused.

“I HAVE A CHILD,” she screamed. “PLEASE.”

I told her to come to the alley. Kay didn’t like it, but I couldn’t let her die out there.

The Test

The woman had a toddler strapped to her chest, both of them soaked in blood. “It’s not mine,” she kept repeating. “Not mine. I killed the infected. It bit me. But I haven’t turned. It’s been two days.”

We pulled her into the alley and started the test.

We’ve developed a crude way to screen people: measure their body heat, heart rate, reflexes, pupil response. It’s not foolproof, but enough to tell if someone’s mid-turn.

She passed everything.

Kay was cautious, but I was already pulling the ladder down. I wanted to believe her.

That’s when the kid started convulsing.

Breakdown

Small scratches on the neck. Hard to see. Must’ve been from the fight.

Within seconds, its eyes went dark. Black veins bloomed under the skin. Then it bit her.

The woman didn’t even scream. Just cried. “Not him,” she said. “Not my baby.”

I tried to pull her away, but it was too late. Her shoulder gushed red.

Kay raised the rifle.

“DON’T,” I shouted. “We can still help her.”

Kay hesitated. The mother fell to her knees, rocking the twitching child. Her eyes went glassy. Her breathing shallow. Her lips trembled, muttering to herself in loops.

“I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m fine.”

I grabbed the ladder, yanked it up.

She never even chased us. Just sat there until the Red Hour.

That Night

We heard her again. Not words. Screams. The kind of scream you let out when you’re still aware enough to hate what you’ve become.

Then the sounds changed—short, fast bursts of breath. Twitching limbs. The child joined in. Their voices layered, then fell into perfect sync. Like something inside them had snapped into place.

They’re part of a pack now. Still downstairs. Still calling out.

And I think they remember us.

The next morning, the streets were quiet again. But we knew it was temporary. The Red Hour would return. And so would they.

We started packing. Kay said it was time to move. We couldn’t stay here anymore. The attic was safe, but it wasn’t sustainable. We had to reach the university outpost rumored across the river.

Five miles. Through enemy territory.

We leave at dawn.
