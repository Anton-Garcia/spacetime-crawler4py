this is from r/copypasta:

It's a rainy day. You go to the movies because it's raining and you notice they're playing A Minecraft Movie in theatre 2. You say to yourself, 
"I've seen the trailers, and I wonder if it actually looks that bad irl..." as you buy a ticket. You walk in and are met with... a movie. It certainly is a movie. 
You'd even go so far as to say it's one of the movies ever made. You're almost to the climax of the film, and you've had a couple chuckles here and there, 
but all in all, it's a mid-tier movie. Suddenly, Jason Momoa and Jack Black appear in a boxing ring. The theatre goes quiet, almost as if they're waiting for 
something to happen. The camera cuts to a chicken under a trapdoor. The trapdoor then opens and releases a zombie, who hops onto the chicken. Jack Black then belligerently
utters arguably the two most infamous words in all of cinema: "CHICKEN JOCKEY!!!" The whole theatre erupts in a mess of popcorn, a splash of drinks, and even
a live chicken. It is pure chaos. The theatre gets swarmed by cops. Jack Black comes out of nowhere, in front of the big screen, yelling obscenities at the
crowd as he gets carried away in handcuffs. A smoke bomb is thrown. Someone lets off fireworks in the cinema and it starts an enormous blaze. Everyone runs
out of the theatre as fast as they can. Except for you. You're there, still sitting in your seat, your heart palpitating, your vision starting to warp and
blur, your ears ringing. The room starts to spin, and your legs begin to shake as you fall to the floor, convulsing, your brain nothing but mush. And then
you wake up. It's July 7th, 2016. You wake up on your friend's trampoline, saying to them that you've just had the weirdest dream imaginable, and, as you
explain it, they begin to look at you like you have two heads. They offer you some lemonade to sip on as you recall all the feelings you felt, the 
experiences you had, and the friends you made along the way.
